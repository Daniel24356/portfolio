        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          From an early age, I spent much of my holiday time behind a computer—whether playing games,
          experimenting with CorelDRAW, or exploring my natural talent for drawing. My curiosity about
          how games were built soon turned into a deeper fascination with the people who created them
          and the career paths they pursued.

          After researching and having thoughtful discussions with my parents, I realized I had the
          passion, interest, and skills to pursue software development. Over time, I transformed from
          someone who only consumed technology into someone driven to create it. Inspired by innovators
          and world-builders like Elon Musk and Bill Gates, I remain motivated to bring ideas to life
          that can make a meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I am dedicated to continuously improving my knowledge and skills—not only for personal
          growth but also for contributing to society. I believe in the power of technology to shape a
          better future, and I am determined to keep working hard, striving toward greater heights, and
          building solutions that will positively influence Nigeria and the world at large.
